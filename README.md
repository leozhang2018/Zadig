## What is Zadig

Zadig is a self-service, cloud-native DevOps platform based on Kubernetes developed by KodeRover. Zadig is available in Basic and Professional editions, and offers flexible and scalable workflow support, multiple release policy orchestration, and one-click security auditing. The platform also supports customized enterprise XOps agile performance dashboards, deep integration with multiple enterprise platforms, and rapid batch access through project templating to achieve one-click governance of thousands of services.

Its main goal is to help enterprises realize the digital transformation of production and research, enable engineers to become innovation engines, and provide support for the unlimited value links of the digital economy.


> Our vision is: Developer + Zadig = Business success

For more details about system architecture, see [Zadig System Architecture Overview](System-Architecture-Overview.md).

The Highlighted Features:

<details>
  <summary><b>High Concurrency</b></summary>
  Based on cloud-native design, through simple configuration, the system automatically generates workflows to achieve high concurrent execution for continuous delivery relevant tasks such as building, testing and deployment, across multiple services. It significantly improves the efficiency of multi-services deployment in microservice architecture.
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Service-oriented Environment</b></summary>
  With just one set of service configuration, multiple encapsulated environments will be provided automatically within minutes, empowering independent environments for developers, QAs and product managers.

  Minimum to none migration cost of existing environments -- just hosting with one click, the system allows browsing and adjusting all the services at your fingertips.
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Non-intrusive Testing Automation</b></summary>
  Zadig can easily and non-intrusively embed existing testing automation frameworks, and achieve continuous building, testing and deployment via GitHub/GitLab Webhook.

  It also integrates with productivity bots to provide instant quality report, which effectively applies shift-left testing best practices.
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Powerful Template Library</b></summary>
  Shared K8s YAML templates, Helm Chart templates, build templates, etc., across projects to achieve unified configuration management. Based on a set of templates, hundreds of microservices can be created, and with minimal configuration by development engineers, self-service usage is enabled, significantly reducing the burden of operations and maintenance management.
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Secure and Reliable Release Management</b></summary>
  Customized workflows that integrate engineer, process, and internal and external system compliance approvals, supporting flexible orchestration of deployment strategies such as blue-green deployment, canary release, phased gray release, and Istio release. Presenting the state of the production environment from a multi-cluster, multi-project perspective, it achieves transparency and reliability in the release process.
  </details>

<details>
 <summary><b>Stable and Efficient Customer Delivery</b></summary>
  Simplify the implementation process for vendors to customer versions, customer private clouds, public clouds, and offline environments, as well as product license management. The supplier management plane collaborates with the customer console to complete the implementation, update, and maintenance process for customer environments, enhancing the quality of external services provided by the enterprise.
 </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Objective and Accurate Performance Insights</b></summary>
  Comprehensive understanding of the system's operational status, including data overviews on clusters, projects, environments, workflows, and key process pass rates. It provides objective performance metrics data for various aspects like builds, tests, and deployments at the project level, enabling precise analysis of development efficiency bottlenecks and promoting steady improvement.
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Convenient Development CLI/IDE Plugin</b></summary>
  Zadig also provides a convenient toolkit with development commandline interface which allows compiling, building and deploying the changes to dev environment with one command.
